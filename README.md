# Learn OpenGL

Learning OpenGL to practically understand computer graphics is fun and exciting journey.
One have to through skills like library consumption, project management, build management, 
design principles, language understanding, linear algebra, etc.


# RUN IT

Following is the process to run the project in MacOS but it should be same for Linux too.
Haven't tested it on Windows, probably needs additions build configuration to support Windows.

```bash
chmod +x debug.sh
./debug.sh
./build/OpenGLApp
```
